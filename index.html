       		<hr class="my-4">
       		<p>We set our sights high in 2018. Among many goals, we worked to become a more diverse and inclusive company, incorporate sustainability in every project we design, improve our safety, meet our financial goals, and, above all, meet our clients' needs for sustainable, innovation infrastructure and technology solutions. We have a lot to celebrate in 2018, as you'll read throughout this report. </p>
					<p>A key achievement of our sustainability program in 2018 was completing our Corporate Sustainability Office Lease Commitment. We signed the document in partnership with our corporate real estate firm to ensure that we consider sustainable features when we select new office space—such as use of eco-friendly cleaning projects, availability of bike rakes, access to electric vehicle charging stations, utility monitoring capabilities, recycling programs, and adherence to green building ratings, standards, or certifications. </p>
					<p>Evaluating office locations based on sustainable features has been a practice for years. The commitment formalizes our approach and affirms that we are committed to choosing properties that complement our philosophy of sustainability and help us reach our corporate goals. Read more about the commitment in the About Us section. </p>
					<p>Equally important is our ongoing efforts to benchmark our progress in reducing waste and conserving resources, as reported in our Tracking Progress. Since we began our formal reporting program in 2010, we have achieved $810,995 in utility savings at our corporate headquarters and Valley Forge office through building efficiencies and capital improvements. We continue to reflect on how we can improve for the future and make an even bigger impact on our bottom line and on the environment.</p>
					<p>We are pleased with our progress but know that sustainability is a journey in which we are constantly improving, or, as the theme of this report suggests, seeking new limits. On all levels of our business and across geographic boundaries, employees have embraced a spirit of sustainability that is reflected in our ever-evolving wellness, learning, safety and programs, community and professional service, and in our sustainable solutions for our clients that provide triple bottom line returns. </p>
					<p>Our passion and drive to go above and beyond is deeply rooted in our firm's history. Our founder's father, Henry Gannett, is a great example of someone who literally reached new heights. He performed extensive geographic surveys in the West and founded the National Geographic Society. His efforts are honored by two mountains in the U.S. that bear the name Gannett. In leading our sustainability program forward, we embrace and carry forward this spirit of advancement, excitement, and high-performance. </p>
