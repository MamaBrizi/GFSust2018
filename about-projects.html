						<p class="lead">Gannett Fleming introduced a breakthrough design concept that makes on-demand, urban air mobility possible. The design brings to life Uber's goal to integrate small, electric aircraft that take off and land vertically, called eVTOL, into our transportation networks. The intent is to alleviate transportation congestion on the ground, reduce pollution, and improve passenger quality of life by making transportation accessible, reliable, and convenient for everyone, everywhere.</p>
						<p class="lead">Gannett Fleming's design concept was unveiled in May at the 2018 Uber Elevate Summit and emerged as one of the top three finalists in the Uber Elevate Skyport Challenge. Also, the design concept won a 2018 GOOD DESIGN® Award in the transportation category from the Chicago Athenaeum: Museum of Architecture and Design and the European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies. GOOD DESIGN, which attracted a record number of applicants in 2018, is hailed as the oldest and most recognized global design award in the world. The program celebrates innovative contemporary design and manufacturing.

Gannett Fleming Transit &amp; Rail Systems is the owner's representative for electrification support services for the program—a $1.7 billion effort to electrify a 52-mile passenger rail route from San Francisco to San Jose.</p>
									<p>APTA's Sustainability Commitment program is a voluntary platform for public transit agencies and businesses to commit to environmental, social, and economic sustainability actions. With this recognition, Caltrain joins 14 other Silver Level recipients.</p>
									<p>The modernization program received recognition for expanding its use of electricity, using 100 percent renewable power from sources such as wind, solar, and small hydroelectric. This sustainable power will reduce Caltrain's carbon footprint from electricity use by nearly 20 percent.</p>

									<p>Gannett Fleming had its second project registered with the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI) in 2018. The registration makes the project eligible to receive the organization's Envision award, which recognizes infrastructure projects for their community, environmental, and economic benefits based on a defined rating system.</p>
									<p>The project ensures that residents of a Virginia coastal community can continue to enjoy reliable, resilient, sustainable wastewater service for years to come. The 70-year-old Ferebee Avenue and Park Avenue Pump Stations, along with the 7,000 linear feet of 12-inch force main and 18- and 24-inch gravity sewer connecting them, were well beyond the end of their useful lives. At the same time, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identified this infrastructure for replacement as part of HRSD's Rehabilitation Action Plan, aimed at reducing sanitary sewer overflows and their influence on the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
									<p>In alignment with HRSD's mission to protect public health and the waters of Hampton Roads by treating wastewater effectively, sustainability was at the forefront of Gannett Fleming's project design. We used a triple bottom line approach for alternatives analysis and design, balancing financial, environmental, and social factors. The Envision Pre-Assessment Checklist was used to guide the design alternatives, and for the first time, HRSD registered a project on the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure's website for potential Envision verification in the future.</p>

									<p>The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Central Pennsylvania presented the Climate Champion Honorable Mention award to Gannett Fleming and Messiah College for their student enhancement projects. Completed in 2017, these improvements included implementation of a new combined cooling, heat, and power (CCHP) plant on campus that serves more than 3,000 students and faculty, as well as the renovation of the sports facilities and dining hall.</p>
									<p>The CCHP provides year-round energy from a single natural gas fuel source, with a total emissions reduction equivalent to more than 1,300 vehicles on the road. As a result, Messiah College saved more than $600,000 in utility costs, facilitating the expansion of the sports center and dining facility.</p>
									<p>Gannett Fleming provided electrical, mechanical, plumbing, structural, and geotechnical services for the CCHP and Sollenberger Sports Center and Eisenhower Dining Hall Additions. The project promoted wellness and recreation while integrating environmentally conscious energy sources throughout the campus. Sustainable features of the renovated facilities include energy-efficient LED lighting and a new rain garden to aid in stormwater management.</p>
